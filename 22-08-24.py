#Bitwise operators: in Python allow you to perform operations on the binary representations of integers
"""
Hereâ€™s a list of the bitwise operators in Python, 

1. **Bitwise AND (`&`)**: Compares each bit of two numbers. If both bits are `1`, the resulting bit is `1`; otherwise, it's `0`.

2. **Bitwise OR (`|`)**: Compares each bit of two numbers. If at least one of the bits is `1`, the resulting bit is `1`; otherwise, it's `0`.

3. **Bitwise XOR (`^`)**: Compares each bit of two numbers. If the bits are different, the resulting bit is `1`; if they are the same, the resulting bit is `0`.

4. **Bitwise NOT (`~`)**: Inverts all the bits of a number, changing `0` to `1` and `1` to `0`. This is also known as the bitwise complement.

5. **Bitwise Left Shift (`<<`)**: Shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions, effectively multiplying the number by `2` for each shift.

6. **Bitwise Right Shift (`>>`)**: Shifts the bits of a number to the right by a specified number of positions, effectively dividing the number by `2` for each shift.

#Identity Operators
"""
Identity operators are used to compare the memory locations of two objects. They check whether two variables point to the same object in memory.

is: Returns True if both variables point to the same object.
is not: Returns True if both variables do not point to the same object
"""
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a             # b points to the same object as a
c = [1, 2, 3]  # c is a different object with the same content
print(a is b)       # True: a and b point to the same object
print(a is c)       # False: a and c are different objects
print(a is not c)   # True: a and c are different objects

#Membership Operators
"""
Membership operators are used to check if a value is a member of a collection (such as a list, tuple, or string).

in: Returns True if the value is found in the collection.
not in: Returns True if the value is not found in the collection.
